def: "Data" is a finite sequence of coda, where each
     coda is a pair of data.

def: DATA is the set of all data.

def: A "context" is a symmetric transitive relation
     "=" on DATA such that if A=B, A X = B X, X A = X B,
     A:X = B:X and X:A = X:B for all data X.

def: Data A is "invariant" in context = if A=A.
def: Data A is an "atom" in context = if A is invariant
     and |A|=1.
def: Data A is "atomic" if A=X where X contains
     an atom in it's sequence.

Given any data D, the context "generated by D" is defined
to be the intersection of all contexts where D is not
atomic.

Examples:

D = (x:)=1 (x:)=2

Any context generated by D has D = (1=1) (1=2) which
is atomic since (1=2)=(:)
