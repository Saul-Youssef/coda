    "### Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the minimalist endpoint of a series of projects I have worked on for a number of years.  These \n",
    "projects have converged to a tiny axiomatic system that appears to have quite interesting mathematical \n",
    "and computational properties.   \n",
    "\n",
    "   First note that any system of reasoning must contain undefined terms which are understood before a first \n",
    "definition can be made.  In the standard foundation of mathematics, for instance, there \n",
    "is no defintion for *proposition*, *variable*, *true*, *false*, etc.  These are introduced as items \n",
    "in a formal language with axioms.  These items and axioms are then supposed to correspond to and \n",
    "formalize mathematical thought.  For instance, Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory has ten axioms including \n",
    "the Axiom of Choice.  \n",
    "\n",
    "   In our approach, we attempt a drastic simplification.  Only the concept of a finite sequences is assumed to be \n",
    "understood without definition.  In addition, there is only one axiom, which defines what constitutes \n",
    "a valid definition.  If we do this, the normal concepts of mathematics (logic, variables, functions, proofs, \n",
    "theorems, categories, morphisms, functors,..) appear naturally, all as different species of \"data.\"  Unlike some \n",
    "other axiomatic and software frameworks, the concept of a \"type\" also appears naturally.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Foundation \n",
    "\n",
    "As noted above, we assume \"finite sequences\" and \"collections\" as concepts which is understood without definition.  This means that we can speak of operations \n",
    "on finite sequences such as concatenating sequences, reversing the order \n",
    "of a finite sequence, etc. as understood without explanation.  A function is \n",
    "understood as a (not necessarily finite) collection of pairs.  Given this basis, \n",
    "the essential definitions are as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **data** is a finite sequence of **codas**.\n",
    "* A **coda** is a pair of **data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this concept of data, meaning enters by introducting \"definitions.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **definition** is a partial function from coda to data. \n",
    "* A **context** is a finite collection of definitions with disjoint domains. \n",
    "\n",
    "The coda concept provides a way of defining the domain of a definition when it is introduced.  By convention a \n",
    "coda (A:B) is in the domain of f depending on the first item (if any) of the data A.  For example, the coda \n",
    "\n",
    "* rev : a b c \n",
    "\n",
    "has a definition `rev` associated with it which maps `rev : a b c` to `c b a`.  If the definition associated \n",
    "with a coda is an identity partial function, then the coda is called an **atom**.  For example, the 0 and 1 bits \n",
    "are represented as (:) and (:(:)) and both are atoms because there is an identity definition mapping any coda \n",
    "(:B) to (:B).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a definition f from coda to data, we can extend this to a function from data to data by defining \n",
    "\n",
    "* f(c1 c2 c3...cn) = f(c1)+f(c2)+f(c3)+...+f(cn) \n",
    "\n",
    "where c1...cn are codas, + is concatenation of data as sequences and where f(c) is taken to be the identity if c is not in the domain of f.  If we extend all definitions f like that, then, for data A and B, the relations \n",
    "\n",
    "* A B = f(A) B = A f(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "define a sequence-compatible equivalence relation on all data.  \n",
