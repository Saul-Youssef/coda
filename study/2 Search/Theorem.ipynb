    "From the Logic tutorial, it is familiar that all data has a truth value.  Empty data is, by definition, **true** and atomic data is, by definition, **false**.  Data can also be in between, for instance, assuming that x has not been defined, then (x:) (same as x?) is **undefined** data.  Mathematical propositions which may be true or false are all data, then.  For instance\n",

    "1. not : skip x? : nat : 0 *There are an infinite number of natural numbers.*\n",
    "2. (rev : rev : x?) = x? *Reversing the order of x? twice is the identity.* \n",
    "3. null:x? = () \n",
    "\n",
    "are the propositions 1) there are an infinite number of natural numbers and 2) reversing the order of anything twice does nothing, 3) null applied to any data gives the empty data.  Since nat:0 are the natural numbers, skip x? : nat : 0 is atomic no matter what x? is, so not:skip x?:nat:0 is always empty.  The characteristic of this data is that they are \"never false\", meaning they are false no matter what definition of x? is chosen.  We say that data T is a **theorem** if T is never false.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The most direct way to prove that data T is a theorem is to construct a sequence T=T$_{1}$,T$_{2}$,T$_{3}$...T$_{n}$=() where each step in the sequence is the application of a definition.  Here, we take a less ambitious approach where we test whether T is never false by assigning the undefined data in T to various permutations of data from chosen samples.  If we manage to make T false with any assignment, we can conclude that T is not a theorem. \n",
