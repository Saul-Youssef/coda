### Godel's theorems 

**Theorem** (Godel): It is impossible to prove the consistency of any formal reasoning system which is at least as strong as the standard axiomatization of peano arithmetic. 

*"Thus, I think that your result has solved negatively the foundational question: **there is no rigorous justification for classical mathematics.**
"* 
- John von Neumann to Kurt Goedel, 1930.

In talks at IAS (2010), Voevodsky, for instance, summarizes this as:

1. We "know" that the first order arithmetic is consistent.

2. However, it can be proved that it is impossible to prove that the first order arithmetic is consistent.  

and concludes that one has to take a drastic possibility seriously: that the first order arithmetic is actually inconsistent.

There are two major questions at least:

A. Is mathematics complete? (every statment can be proved or disproved) Truth complete? (every true statement can be proved) consistent (No statement can be both proved and disproved)?

In particular, since Godel showed that there can be no proof that peano arithemetic is consistent, there can be no convincing reason to believe that mathematics as a whole is even consistent. 

B. What axioms should be used for mathematics?  

Godel showed that for any sufficiently strong formal system, there are true statements which cannot be proved within the system.  Does this mean that mathematics must always expand axioms to reach "more truth"?  Should the Axiom of Choice, for instance, be assumed or not?  If one is stuck on a hard problem, how can one tell if it requires new axioms to solve or not? 

Answers:

A.  Coda is not complete since there are undecidable statements.  Coda is truth complete by definition since truth is defined to be emptiness.  Data is true if and only if there is a finite sequence of definitions which reaches the empty sequence.
