Hello Robert...

I have something interesting.  It's a possible foundation for math, computing, logic and proof assistance.

Properties:

o Axiomatically it's quite a bit simpler than, say ZF set theory.
o The axioms define both proof and computation at the same time.
o Results like Godel's theorem appear easily and non-mysteriously.
o Types appear naturally rather than being undefined axiomatic terms.

In this setup, compilation, computation and proof are the same thing.
