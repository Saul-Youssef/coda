#   As an exercise, let's make a native implementation
#   of the natural numbers without using Python underneath.
#   This is partly as an exercise in making types, partly
#   as a starting point for demonstrations of proofs and
#   math searching.
#
#   In order to be used like other types, we follow the
#   convention in Type.co
