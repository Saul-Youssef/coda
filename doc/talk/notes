Origin
   Black hole sequence
Foundation
   For comparison: predicate logic, ZFC, dependent type theory HOTT
Coda
   data, coda, algebra, definition, equality, axiom of definition
   examples: bits and bytes, functions, types, categories, morphisms, theorems...
   pure data
Logic
   (:)->(:); atomic data
   data is true(empty), false(atomic) or undecided(neither)
Language
   {  } A : B
   language is merely one definition
   all byte sequences are valid language expressions
Proof and Computation
   All proofs are computations.  All computations are proofs.
   i.e. not the Curry-Howard correspondence
Category Theory

Global issues
   Is mathematics consistent?
   What are the right axioms for mathematics?
   Computing paradoxes
Applications
   Math exploration and proof-assistance
   Supermodel Applications
   Universal data storage
   Mathematical Machine Learning

Examples:
   definition examples: natural numbers, rev, ap, aps, ...
   classifying odd vs even atoms
   paradoxes
     Liar; truth-teller; Berry; Yablo
   group theory
