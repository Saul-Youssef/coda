A standard set of questions to ask about a space.
Describe things in classical mathematical terms whenever possible.

1. Describe the space and briefly explain it's contents, main operation and neutral data.

2. What global properties does the space have? Possible global properties are:
     Distributive, algebraic, neutral, field, semialgebra, central semialgebra, set, positive, non-zero preserving

3. Describe the constants of the space.

4. Describe the homomorphisms of the space.

5. Describe the group of units and the central homomorphisms of the space.

6. Describe the semialgebra if the space is a semialgebra, or central semialgebra if the space is a semialgebra.
