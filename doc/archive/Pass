Theorem (pass) : pass : B = B

{ { pass : B = B } : (pass : B) } :

f = {pass : B = B}
g = (pass : B)
A = ()
B = ()

Mappings:

cd : maps code to data via the colon
dc : maps data to code via standard building
    e.g. a b c => coda : {a b c}

Let X be a code.  X -> X: is a mapping from code to data.

Given any data D.  c(D): = D

Since, in this formulation, data is always finite, c(D) is also finite.

{pass : B = B}
