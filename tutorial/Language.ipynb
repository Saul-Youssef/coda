    "## The Language\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard foundations of Mathematics is a **formal theory** consisting of the following. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Two **alphabets**, one for **special symbols** like \"&forall;\" and \"&exist;\" and another for **variable** names like \"x\", \"y\", \"z\".\n",
    "2. Syntax rules for excluding meaningless sentences like \"∀ x (y:z) ∀ ∀ ∃\", and for defining **free variables** and closed formulas without free variables. \n",
    "3. **Deduction rules** for constructing closed formulas from closed formulas.\n",
    "4. A collection of closed formulas called **axioms**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The axioms are meant to be \"true\" intuitively so that &forall; is supposed to behave like what we think of as \"for all\", etc.  For example, the Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC) has ten axioms.  This is the most often cited foundation of Mathematics meaning that mathematical results should be reducible, in principle, to valid deductions in ZFC. \n",
    "\n",
    "Coda is meant to be an alternative to this as a foundation.  Rather than assuming or using predicate logic syntax, the foundation of Coda is **finite sequence**.  From this, one defines \"pure\" data and coda.  Logic in is then internal, derived and \"2+ valued\", where `()` and `(:)` are the iconic \"true\" and \"false\" valuea and where there are many \"undecided\" data values like `(foo:bar)`.  Coda has only one axiom - it is the axiom that defines what constitutes a valid definition.  The Coda language itself is merely one definition like any other.  This means that we don't need any additional axioms or deduction rules. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Coda, a definition is just a partial function from codas to data.  The Coda language, for instance, is a partial function from coda to data, acting on codas of the form ({...some source code...} A : B) where A and B are any data.  There are essentially only two operations in coda:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Concatenation of data A and data B, written `A B`.\n",
    "2. Creating a coda from data A and data B, written `A:B`.\n",
    "\n",
    "and the essential idea of the language is to make these two operations specifyable in text string source code ({...some source code...} A : B) and to get programmatic access to the \"A\" data (sometimes called \"argument data\") and the \"B\" data (sometimes called \"input\").  Thus, a sketch of the internal definition is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `{x : y} A : B` &rightarrow; `({x} A : B) : ({y} A : B)` ..to specify forming a coda from two data \n",
    "* `{x   y} A : B` &rightarrow; `({x} A : B)   ({y} A : B)` ..to specify concatenation of two data \n",
    "* `{A} A : B` &rightarrow; `A` ..to get the \"A part\" of the coda.\n",
    "* `{B} A : B` &rightarrow; `B` ..to get the \"B part\" of the coda.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the compiler is merely a standard definition, the meaning of the language does not need a special explanation or additional axioms.  We don't even have to define proper syntax.  Coda has the unusual property that all finite sequences of bytes are valid language expressions.  There is no such thing as a syntax error. \n",
    "\n",
    "The full compiler is tiny, easily readable, and can be found in Language.py.  The full compiler and parser is only about 100 lines of Python."

    "Any system of reasoning must contain undefined terms.  In the case of Coda, the **finite sequence** is the foundational concept that is assumed to be understood without definition.  It's pleasing and expected, then, that the low level operations in Coda are things are the natural low level combinatorial operations on finite sequences.  We've looked at two of these as simple examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `rev` reverses the order of a sequence. \n",

    "\n",
    "which is the same idea, applicable to all \"input\" data (B) and all \"arguments\" (A).  Coda has a collection of these named definitions built into the system.  They are all simple combinations of the three ingredients``(name A : B)`.  These are basic definitions underlying many of the more familiar mathematical objects built on top.  As far as I know, these don't have conventional names, so we are forced into naming them.\n",
